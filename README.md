# Quieter Meatballs
Lowers the volume of (and sometimes modifies) certain sounds in MeatballCraft to normal levels. Mainly AoA, but there's more.

I'm adding to this as I encounter things that make my ears hurt, and I'm not very far in the pack. Feel free to create an issue or PR if you have a sound you want reduced or changed, or if you feel like I messed up a sound in some way.
